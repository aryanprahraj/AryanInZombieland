🧟‍♂️ Aryan In Zombieland

Run. Hide. Collect. Escape. In Zombieland… every sound could be your last.

Aryan In Zombieland is a spooky survival-adventure game where you play as Aryan, trapped in a cursed jungle crawling with the undead.
Your goal: find the hidden key, unlock the escape door, and survive through three terrifying levels — each darker, denser, and deadlier than the last.

🌲 Levels

1. The Whispering Woods – The nightmare begins. Faint growls echo through the fog, and every step feels watched.
2. The Rotten Grove – More zombies. Denser jungle. The air is thick, and the dead are faster… hungrier.
3. The Bloodroot Jungle – The forest is so overgrown, you can’t tell where the next zombie comes from. They’re everywhere — faster, relentless, and closing in. One last chance to escape… or join the undead.
